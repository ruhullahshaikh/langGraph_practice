Wait till you have a son\\\\n\\\\nSo why love anything, anything, anything at all?\\\\nWhy love anything at all?\\\\nIf the higher I fly is the further I fall\\\\nThen why love anything at all?\\\\n\\\\nWhy love?\\\\nWhy love?\\\\nWhy love?\\\\nWhy love?\\\\nWhy love?\\\\nWhy love?\\\\nWhy love?\\\\nWhy love?\\\\nWhy love?\\\\nWhy love?\\\\nAnything at all?\\\\nAnything at all?\\\\n\\\\nIf the higher I fly is the further I fall\\\\nThen why love anything, anything, anything at all?\\\\nWhy love anything at all?\\\\n\\\\nIf the higher I fly is the further I fall\\\\nWhy love\\\\n(Why love)\\\\nAnything at all?\\\\n\\\\n...........................................................\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCREW\\\\n\\\\nDirector/DP -
